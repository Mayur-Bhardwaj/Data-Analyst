list1 = ["Python","Django","Flask","FastAPI"]

for l in list1:
    print(l)

# Output:-

# Django
# Flask

list2 = ["Apple","Mango", "Orange", "Banana"]
for l2 in list2:
    print(l2)
    
print(list2[1:4])

# Output:-
# Apple
# Mango
# Orange
# Banana
# ['Mango', 'Orange', 'Banana']
